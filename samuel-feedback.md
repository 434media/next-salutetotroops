## Impression of Website/Instagram
- Good front cover video that gets to the point.
- Highlights unity within the community in the video
- Instagram posts regularly of news which makes the two platforms drastically different.
- The mission mentions overcomming challenges relating to recruitment, but I feel like both the website and instagram lack on that.
- I see the video on the website is from their sizzle reel. While it highlights the event well I think it lacks on other parts of the mission.

## Suggestions/Ideas
- Maybe add a soundtrack with the video the make it more impactful
- If there is analystics of the outcome of its last event maybe add the statistics in between the mission statement and social media links.
- Maybe sync up the instagram news posts to a section on the website.
